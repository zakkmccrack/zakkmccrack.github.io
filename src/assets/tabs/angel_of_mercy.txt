[Verse]
F        Am
  I woke alone today
G                         F
  For all the birds have flown
F             Am
  Inside this empty house
G                       F
  Which no longer feels like home
 
[Chorus]
C       Am
  No angel of mercy
F          C
  Is gonna hear my call (lord no)
C       Am
  No angel of mercy
F                       Dm
  To dry the tears that shall not fall
 
[Verse]
F        Am
  I woke alone today
G                               F
  Admidst life's killing fields of war
F      Am
  Door of memories
G           F
  Closed forevermore
 
[Verse]
C       Am
  No angel of mercy
F          C
  Is gonna hear my call (lord no)
C       Am
  No angel of mercy
F                       Dm
  To dry the tears that shall not fall
