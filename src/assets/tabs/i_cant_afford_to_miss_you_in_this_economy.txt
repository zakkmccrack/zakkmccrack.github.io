D
Say that I’m a loser
                               G
Call me all your little names
 
Just don’t call me to come over
 
Cuz I’m tired of your games.
              D
Like how you always seem
 
to hit me up when no one else is around
G
i swear to god your fucking voice
 
is my new least favorite sound
  D
I used to love you too much
 
how was I that fucking stupid
  G
The result’s not worth effort
 
always made me feel so useless
       Bm                D
cut my nose off in spite of my face
A
Lose hope in the human race
G
loud fought battles with my faith
 
now all I gotta say is
                  D
Am I the asshole?
                          A
for hoping you have a bad day.
                  G
that it’d make me smile
        D                     A
If your car broke down in the rain
           Bm
Maybe your breaks gave out
        A
or your transmission dropped
         D               Gm
Now your stranded on the highway
                G
I hope you have the day you
                  A           D
deserve and a big tow bill to pay.

D
Say that I’m a liar
 
every word I say is fake
G
Say that I’m the bad guy
 
Say whatever you have to say
   D
To help you fall asleep at night
 
Does he know that you still call
         G
That you have me saved as Domino’s
 
Incase he checks your  logs
   D
Is he your flavor of the week
 
is the taste getting kind of stale?
       G
Are you looking for an exit plan
 
is it about time that you bail?
     Bm
Move on again a bit to fast
   A
to something new that will never last
     G
it’s like an itch that’s left unscratched
 
now All I’ve gotta ask is
 
Am I the asshole?
    D                     A
for hoping you have a bad day.
                  G
that it’d make me smile

or your transmission dropped
         G               Gm
now your stranded on the highway
                G
I hope you have the day you
              A               D
deserve and a big tow bill to pay.
