[Intro]
 
Esus4
(arpeggiated)
 
 
[Verse]
 
 Em                       G
No one knows what it's like
            D  Dsus4
to be the bad man
             Cadd9
to be the sad man
   Asus2
behind blue eyes
 
Em                       G
No one knows what it's like
            D  Dsus4
to be hated
             Cadd9
to be fated
   Asus2
to telling only lies
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           C     D
But my dreams
              G
they aren't as empty
        C         D         E
as my conscience seems to be
          Bsus2          C
I have hours, only lonely
                D
my love is vengeance
               Asus2
that's never free
 
 
[Verse]
 
 Em                       G
No one knows what it's like
            D  Dsus4
to feel these feelings
             Cadd9
like I do
   Asus2
and I blame you
 
 Em                       G
No one bites back as hard
            D  Dsus4
on their anger
             Cadd9
none of my pain and woe
   Asus2
can show through
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           C     D
But my dreams
              G
they aren't as empty
        C         D         E
as my conscience seems to be
          Bsus2          C
I have hours, only lonely
                D
my love is vengeance
               Asus2
that's never free
 
 
[Bridge]
 
E   Bsus2   A
 
 E           Bsus2     A           E
When my fist clenches, crack it open
E        Bm         G        D
Before I use it and lose my cool
       Bsus2  A            D
When I smile, tell me some bad news
         Bm        A          E  Bsus2 A
Before I laugh and act like a fool
E        Bsus2   A        E
And if I swallow anything evil
E        Bm     G       D
Put your finger down my throat
         Bsus2          A         D
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
        Bm           A         E Bsus2 A
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

[Verse]
 
 Em                       G
No one knows what it's like
            D  Dsus4
to be the bad man
             Cadd9
to be the sad man
   Asus2
