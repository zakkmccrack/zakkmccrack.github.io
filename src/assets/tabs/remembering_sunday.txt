[Verse 1]
 
Cmaj7                                     Em
   He woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes
                             Cadd9
   Started making his way past two in the morning
                             A7
   He hasn't been sober for days
Cmaj7
   Leaning now into the breeze
 Dsus2
   Remembering Sunday he falls to his knees
           Em
   They had breakfast together
            Em
   But two eggs don't last
            A7
   Like the feeling of what he needs
Cmaj7
   Now this place seems familiar to him
 Dsus2
   She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
      Em
   She led him upstairs, she led him upstairs
           A7
   Left him dying to get in
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  G                       Cadd9
   Forgive me I'm trying to find
                          A7
   My calling, I'm calling at night
 
   I don't mean to be a bother
      Cadd9
   But have you seen this girl?
  G                             Cadd9
   She's been running through my dreams
                               A7
   And it's driving me crazy it seems
                             Cadd9
   I'm gonna ask her to marry me
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Cmaj7                                Dsus2
  Even though she doesn't believe in love
                             Em
  He's determined to call her bluff
                               A7
  Who could deny, these butterflies?
 
  They're filling his gut
Cmaj7                  Dsus2
  Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces
    Em
  He pleads though he tries
    Em
  But he's only denied
           A7
  Now he's dying to get inside
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                       Cadd9
   Forgive me I'm trying to find
                          A7
   My calling, I'm calling at night
           A7
   I don't mean to be a bother
      Cadd9
   But have you seen this girl?
  G                             Cadd9
   She's been running through my dreams
                               A7
   And it's driving me crazy it seems
                             Cadd9
   I'm gonna ask her to marry me
 
 
[Bridge]
 
 Em                           Cadd9
  The neighbors said she moved away
                          G
  Funny how it rained all day
                G
  I didn't think much of it then
             D
  But it's starting to all make sense
 D         Em                  Cadd9
  Oh I can see now that all of these clouds
     G
  Are following me in my desperate endeavor
    D                                G
  To find my whoever, whoever she may be
 
 
[Bridge 2] (Juliet Simms)
 
      G                                      Cadd9
  I'm not coming back, I've done something so terrible
                                                    A7
  I'm terrified to speak, but you'd expect that from me
                     A7
  I'm mixed up, I'll be blunt, now the rain is just
Cadd9                                     G
  Washing you out of my hair and out of my mind
                G
  Keeping an eye on the world
Cadd9
  So many thousands of feet off the ground
      A7
  I'm over you now, I'm at home in the clouds
Cadd9
  Towering over your head
 
 
[Outro] (Alex Gaskarth)
 
                 Em
  I guess I'll go home now
                 Dsus2
  I guess I'll go home now
                 Em
  I guess I'll go home now
                 A7
  I guess I'll go home.
