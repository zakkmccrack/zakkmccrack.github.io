[Verse]
          C         C/B
there's a moment in time
         Am          G     F
and it's stuck in my mind
(F)           G
way back when we were just kids
         C             C/B
cuz your eyes told the tale
      Am     G            F
of an act of betrayal
(F)         G
i knew that somebody did
F           G
oh waves of time
        C     C/B     Am            G
seem to wash away the scenes of our crimes
    F              G
for you this never ends
 
[Chorus]
        C
can you stay strong
        Am
can you go on
Dm                   F' G'
Kristy are you doing okay
            C
a rose that won't bloom
        Am
winters kept you
      Dm                              F                 G
don't waste your whole life trying to get back what was taken away
 
C F G
 
[Verse]
           C             C/B             Am       G        F
though the marks on your dress have been neatly repressed
(F)                       G
i knew that something was wrong
      C             C/B
and i shoulda spoke out
        Am       G
and i'm so sorry now
   F                         G
i didn't know cuz we were so young
F            G            C       C/B  Am        G
oh clouds of time seem to rain on innocence left behind
    F          G
and never goes away
 
[Chorus]
        C
can you stay strong
        Am
can you go on
Dm                   F' G'
Kristy are you doing okay
            C
a rose that won't bloom
        Am
winters kept you
      Dm                              F                G
don't waste your whole life trying to get back what was taken away
