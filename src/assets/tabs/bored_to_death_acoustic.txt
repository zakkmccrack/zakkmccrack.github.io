Capotasto: none or 2/3
 
[Intro]
Am C F F
 
 
[Verse]
Am              C                 F
  There's an echo pulling out the meaning...
Am           C                F
  Rescuing a nightmare from a dream!
Am               C               F
The voices in my head are always screaming
Am                      C           F
That none of this means anything to me
 
 
[Pre Chorus]
           Am
And it's a long way back from seventeen
    C
The whispers turn into a scream
    F
And I'm not coming home
 
 
[Chorus]
C
  Save your breath, I'm nearly
G                           Am
  Bored to death and fading fast
F
  Life is too short to last long
C
  Back on earth I'm broken
G                          Am
  Lost and cold and fading fast
F
  Life is too short to last LONG!
 
 
[Verse]
Am                 C                F
  There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Am           C            F
  Rescuing a tiger from a tree
Am                    C               F
  The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Am                   C             F
  Each of them means everything to me
 
 
[Pre Chorus]
           Am
And it's a long way back from seventeen
    C
The whispers turn into a scream
    F
And I'm not coming home
 
 
[Chorus]
C
  Save your breath, I'm nearly
G                           Am
  Bored to death and fading fast
F
  Life is too short to last long
C
  Back on earth I'm broken
G                          Am
  Lost and cold and fading fast
F
  Life is too short to last LONG!

C                                                    F
 I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down
           G                        C
I said I'm sorry I'm a bit of a let down
                                         F
But all my friends are daring me to come over
          G                 C
So I come over and over and over
So let me buy you a drink
                           F
And we'll pretend that you think
                         G
That I'm the man of your dreams
                       C
Come to life in a dive bar
                               F
And we'll go over and over and over...
             G                 C
And we'll go over and over and over...
                               F
And we'll go over and over and over...
             G
And we'll go over and over and over...
 
 
[Chorus]
C
  Save your breath, I'm nearly
G                           Am
  Bored to death and fading fast
F
  Life is too short to last long
C
  Back on earth I'm broken
G                          Am
  Lost and cold and fading fast
F
  Life is too short to last LONG!
