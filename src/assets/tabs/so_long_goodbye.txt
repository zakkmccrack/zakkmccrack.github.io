    G          Cadd9  D         G
As time passes by, direction unknown
G              Cadd9    D          G
You've left us now but we're not alone
G          Cadd9         D         G
Before you know it your cups overflown
G            Cadd9       D           G
You measured no one that I've ever known
 
 
        Cadd9  D  G
And it's quite alright
      Cadd9  D   Em
And goodbye for now
          C
Just look up to the stars
       D
And believe who you are
            Em   D Cadd9
Cause it's quite alright
       Cadd9  D   G
And so long, goodbye

We always knew that it'd come to this
G               Cadd9      D          G
It's times like these I forget what I miss
G          Cadd9     D         G
Matters of heart are hard to address
  G             Cadd9         D       G
Especially when yours is full of emptiness
 
        Cadd9  D   G
And it's quite alright
      Cadd9  D   Em
And goodbye for now
          C
Just look up to the stars
       D
And believe who you are
           Em    D Cadd9
Cause it's quite alright
       Cadd9  D   G
And so long, goodbye
