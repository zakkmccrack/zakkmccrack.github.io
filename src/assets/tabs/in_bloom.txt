[Verse]
   C                                G   Am G/B
Sometimes at night I let it get to me
        C                                  G  Am G/B
And sometimes I'm sure it gets to all of us
        C                                     G Am G/B
And last night it had me down and feeling numb
     C                                    G
I can try but sometimes that is not enough
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am              D                  C
   No sometimes that is not enough
                             G    Am G/B
No sometimes that is not enough
 
[Chorus]
C
And stop calling me out we're never going to
G
Put the pieces back together
Am               G/B
If you won't let me get better
C
And stop digging it up or we're never gonna
G      Am  G/B C       G
See it all in  bloom
Am G/B
 
[Verse]
C
And thinking back upon those days
 
Way way back when I was young
G                   Am
I was such a little shit
          G/B            G
Cos I was always on the run
C
Well you know just what they say
N.C.
Just like father then like son
G                          Am
Don't delude me with your sympathy
          G/B             C
Cos I can do this on my own
 
[Pre-Chorus]
    G
And this will be the last time
     Am                                  G/B
That I break down and wanna crawl to bed
        G
Cos the truth is
           Am                          D
You're the only voice I wanna hear in my head
 
[Chorus]
C
And stop calling me out we're never going to
G
Put the pieces back together
Am               G/B
If you won't let me get better
C
And stop digging it up or we're never gonna
G      Am  G/B C
See it all in  bloom
C C G G
Am G/B
C C C
Am G/B
 
[Chorus]
 G
And stop calling me out we're never going to
Em                          G
Put the pieces back together
 
If you won't let me get better
C
And stop digging it up or we're never gonna
G       Am G/B C       G
See it all in  bloom
 
[Outro]
Am   G  C     G
All in bloom
Am   G  C
All in bloom
