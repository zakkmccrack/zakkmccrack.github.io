Mama told me when I was young
          C       G         Am    Am7
Come sit beside me, my only son
           C      G          Am    Am7
And listen closely to what I say
           C
And if you do this
      G             Am                  Am7
It'll help you some sunny day. Oh Yeah!

Troubles will come and they will pass.

You'll find a woman, yea yea, you'll find love,

There is someone up above.
