[Verse]
       C
Do you ever feel like breaking down?
       Am
Do you ever feel out of place?
     F
Like somehow you just don't belong,
    G
and no one understands you.
       C
Do you ever wanna run away?
       Am
Do you lock yourself in your room?
         F
With the radio on turned up so loud
     G
That no one hears you screaming.
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
       F
No you don't know what its like
     Am
When nothing feels alright
    F                                   G
You don't know what its like to be like me
 
 
[Chorus]
      Am            F           C               G
To be hurt, to feel lost, to be left out in the dark
      Am                 F                  C                   G
To be kicked when you're down, to feel like you've been pushed around 
      Am             F                   C                 G
To be on the edge of breaking down, when no one's there to save you
       Dm
No you don't know what its like
F             C
Welcome to my life 
 
 
[Verse]
       C
Do you wanna be somebody else?
        Am
Are you sick of being so left out?
        F
Are you desperate to find something more,
G
before your life is over?
        C
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
        Am
Are you sick of everyone around?
         F
With the big fake smiles and stupid lies,
      G
While deep inside you're bleeding
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
F
No you don't know what its like
     Am
When nothing feels alright
    F                                   G
You don't know what its like to be like me
 
 
[Chorus]
      Am            F           C               G
To be hurt, to feel lost, to be left out in the dark
      Am               F                  C                   G
To be kicked when your down, to feel like you've been pushed around
      Am             F                   C                G
To be on the edge of breaking down, when no ones there to save you
       Dm
No you don't know what its like
F             C
Welcome to my life
 
 
[Bridge]
F
No one ever lies straight to your face
    Am
And no one ever stabs you in the back
F
You might think I'm happy 
        C            G
But I'm not gonna be okay
F
Everybody always gave you what you wanted
    Am
You never had to work it was always there
    F                                   G
You don't know what it's like what it's like..
 
 
[Chorus]
      Am            F           C               G
To be hurt, to feel lost, to be left out in the dark
      Am                 F                  C                   G
To be kicked when you're down, to feel like you've been pushed around
      Am             F                   C                G
To be on the edge of breaking down, when no ones there to save you
Dm                                        F
No you don't know what its like, what its like
      Am            F           C               G
To be hurt, to feel lost, to be left out in the dark
      Am                 F                  C                   G
To be kicked when you're down, to feel like you've been pushed around
      Am             F                   C                G
To be on the edge of breaking down, when no ones there to save you
       Dm
No you don't know what its like
F               C    Am
  Welcome to my life
              F    G
Welcome to my life
              C
Welcome to my life
