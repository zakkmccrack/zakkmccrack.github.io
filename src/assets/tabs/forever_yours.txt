[Verse 1]
Am
     Stained glass patterns porcelain
     F
Your watercolors running
                                       Am
All your paintings are fading from the walls
Am
Miss, I miss the way you breathe
                      F
The way you twitch in your sleep
F
Your smile, your straight teeth
F                            G
And the scars along on your cheeks
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G                                  F
Ooh, ooh, I should have wrote that letter
                                           G
You looked beautiful in white but I stayed home, oh
                 F
Could never live without you, but I guess I’ll have to
       C
You're gone, gone, gone
 
[Chorus]
C              G                    Am
All the promises, vows under the covers
                  F
We would play pretend my love
                   C
But it was real to me
                      G
Now I waste my days away
                  Am
I know I can’t recover
           F                              C
There’s no love lost, but I’ll be forever yours
 
[Verse 2]
Am
Walk the grove we’d always go
                          F
Where the summer made our shadows tall
                                          Am
I look out for them, but now there's only one
Am
Run my hands through winter grass
                    F
Pretend I feel your warmth again
F
But the grass is cold and dead
F
My pain might never end
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G              F
Ooh, ooh, that cathedral hall
                                    G
And that ivy wall, aisle I'll never know, oh
                     F
Could never live without you, but I guess I’ll have to
                        C
You're gone, gone, gone
 
[Chorus]
C              G                 Am
All the promises, vows under the covers
                  F
We would play pretend my love
                   C
But it was real to me
                      G
Now I waste my days away
                  Am
I know I can’t recover
               F                          C
There’s no love lost, but I’ll be forever yours
 
[Bridge]
         G             Am
Forever yours, forever yours
   F                              C
No love lost, but I’ll be forever yours
         G             Am
Forever yours, forever yours
   F                              Am
No love lost, but I’ll be forever yours
 
[Verse 3]
Am
Place my bouquet of old regrets
                      F
Drop the weight of my sins
F
The ground takes in the better man I could have been
 
[Chorus]
C              G                 Am
All the promises, vows under the covers
                  F
We would play pretend my love
                   C
But it was real to me
                      G
Now I waste my days away
                  Am
I know I can’t recover
               F                          C
There’s no love lost, but I’ll be forever yours
 
[Outro]
         G             Am
Forever yours, forever yours
   F                              C
No love lost, but I’ll be forever yours
         G             Am
Forever yours, forever yours
   F                              C
No love lost, but I’ll be forever yours
