D  A  G  D  (2x)
 
[Verse 1]
D                           G
When dreaming I'm guided to another world
              D   G
Time and time again
   D                         G
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
                                  D               G
Because I don't want to leave the comfort of this place
                  D                      G
Because there's a hunger, a longing to escape
              D                  G
From the life I live when I'm awake
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         F#m
So let's go there
      G
Let's make our escape
               F#m
Come on, let's go there
      G
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"
 
[Chorus]
D          A      G   D
 Can you take me higher?
D     A            G         D
 To a place where blind men see
D          A      G   D
 Can you take me higher?
D      A          G       D
 To a place with golden streets
 
[Verse 2]
D                                  G
Although I would like our world to change
               D
It helps me to appreciate
                       G
Those nights and those dreams
     D                        G
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
                    D                       G
If I could make the earth and my dreams the same
    D               G
The only difference is
            D               G
To let love replace all our hate
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         F#m
So let's go there
      G
Let's make our escape
               F#m
Come on, let's go there
      G
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"
 
[Chorus]
D         A       G  D
 Can you take me higher?
D     A            G        D
 To a place where blind men see
D         A      G   D
 Can you take me higher?
D      A          G       D
 To a place with golden streets
 
[Post-Chorus]
         F#m
So let's go there
      G
Let's go there
               F#m
Come on, let's go there
      G
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"

[Bridge]
D             A             G             D
  Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
D                    A              G                     D
  Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine
D              A              G            D
......         ......         ......       ......
D                    A              G                     D
  Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine
 
[Chorus]
D         A       G  D
 Can you take me higher?
D     A            G        D
 To a place where blind men see
D         A      G   D
 Can you take me higher?
D      A          G       D
 To a place with golden streets
D         A       G  D
 Can you take me higher?
D     A            G        D
 To a place where blind men see
D         A      G   D
 Can you take me higher?
D      A          G       D
 To a place with golden streets
