Em  C  D  (x2)
C  D  C  D  Em  D  (x2)
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
Em                     C          D
With bloodshot eyes I watch you sleeping
Em                         C           D
The warmth I feel beside me is slowly fading
 
 
[Bridge]
 
           Em           C       D
Would she hear me if I called her name?
           Em              C       D
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Em
There's always something different going wrong
    C                D
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
Em
There's always someone fucking hanging on
    C                D
Can anybody help me make it better?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C                   D                         C
  Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
                D          Em       D     C
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
                  D                        C
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
                D          Em        D    Em
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Em                  C         D
The moments die, I hear no screaming
Em                        C            D
The visions left inside me are slowly fading
 
 
[Bridge]
 
           Em           C          D
Would she hear me if I called her name?
           Em              C       D
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Em
There's always something different going wrong
    C                D
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
Em
There's always someone fucking hanging on
    C                D
Can anybody help me make it better?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C                   D                         C
  Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
                D          Em       D     C
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
                  D                        C
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
                D          Em        D    Em
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
 
 
[Solo]
 
 
[Bridge]
 
           Em           C          D
Would she hear me if I called her name?

Would she hold me if she knew my shame?

Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home

Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
                D          Em        D    Em
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
 
 
[Outro]
 
Better!
C                      D
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
C                      D    Em       D
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
