[Verse 1]
 
      A              Bm
I'm a ghost in your eyes.
   D                 A          Bm
A shadow you can't seem to recognize.
   D                A               Bm
I have a thought of you for every, star in the sky
    D                  A                Bm
But I'm scared, I'll never cross your mind.
       D     A
Yeah, I'm scared.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Bm
Will our stars ever align?
G
Will two hearts, beat in time?
D
These words you should always remember,
A
To you, my heart I surrender.
Bm
Chasing love that can never be mine.
G
Maybe one day you'll realize.
D
These words you should always remember, 
A
To you, my heart I surrender.
