[Verse]
 
Em        G     D                Em
Hey darling, I hope you're good tonight
      G                   D
And I know you don't feel right when I'm leaving
Em
Yeah, I want it but no, I don't need it
G                 D               Em
Tell me something sweet to get me by
       G                 D
'Cause I can't come back home 'til they're singin'
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
C         D         Em
La, la la la, la la la
     G           D
'Til everyone is singin'
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                    D
If you can wait 'til I get home
       Em                                 C           G
Then I swear to you that we can make this last (La la la)
                     D
If you can wait 'til I get home
       Em                                           C
Then I swear come tomorrow, this will all be in our past
   G                D
It might be for the best
 
 
[Verse]
 
Em        G     D                Em
Hey sweetie, I need you here tonight
      G                   D
And I know that you don't wanna be leaving
Em
Yeah, you want it but I can't help it
G                 D               Em
I just feel complete when you're by my side
       G                 D
But I know you can't come home 'til they're singin'
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
C         D         Em
La, la la la, la la la
     G           D
'Til everyone is singin'
C         D         Em
La, la la la, la la la
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                    D
If you can wait 'til I get home
       Em                                 C           G
Then I swear to you that we can make this last (La la la)
                     D
If you can wait 'til I get home
       Em                                           C
Then I swear come tomorrow, this will all be in our past
   G                D
It might be for the best
 
 
[Bridge]
 
C                                 G
You know you can't give me what I need
                            Em
And even though you mean so much to me
                    D
I can wait through everything
 
Is this really happening?
C                           G
I swear I'll never be happy again
                              Em
And don't you dare say we can just be friends
                              D
I'm not some boy that you can sway
 
We knew it'd happen eventually
 
 
[Outro]
 
C         D         Em
La, la la la, la la la
     G           D
Now everybody's singin'
C         D         Em
La, la la la, la la la
     G           D
Now everybody's singin'
C         D         Em
If you can wait 'til I get home 
     G           D
Now everybody's singin'
C         D         Em
Then I swear we can make this last
     G           D
Now everybody's singin'
C         D         Em
If you can wait 'til I get home
     G           D
Now everybody's singin'
C         D         Em
Then I swear we can make this last
