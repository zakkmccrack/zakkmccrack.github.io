Capotasto: senza capotasto
 
      D       A      G
If I could I surely would
 D     A         G
Child ease your pain
    D      A        G
But if I could no longer
           D     A       G
Would you still know my name?
 
        D       A         G
If I couldn't drain the tears
      D    A          G
That pour from these eyes
  D                  A
Would you turn your back on me
 G
Would you wave goodbye?
 
             D         A        G
Or leave me way beyond empty inside
   D         A             G
Awaiting my last day to arrive
 D          A     G
Way beyond empty inside
 D          A       G
Awaiting my end to arrive
 
      D       A       G
If I couldn't be the shoulder
            D          A     G
Which your head would rest upon
 D                  A
Would you still be waiting (mama)
G
Or would you be gone?
      D        A        G
If I couldn't keep the smile
    D   A        G
Forever on your face
 D            A
Would I still be around
    G
Or would I be replaced?
 
      D          A       G
(Yeah)Way beyond empty inside
   D         A            G
Awaiting my last day to arrive (yeah)
 D          A       G
Way beyond empty inside
   D        A       G
Awaiting my end to arrive
 
 
(GUITAR SOLO)
 
       D         A      G
(And) Would you promise me
  D            A      G
Things they'd never change
 D         A      G
Could you promise me
       D            A        G
That things they'd stay the same?
 
      D        A         G
If I couldn't clear the clouds
     D  A       G
From over your head
  D                  A
Would you keep your word to me
         G
Amongst all the things you said?
 
             D         A        G
Or leave me way beyond empty inside
   D         A             G
Awaiting my last day to arrive
 D          A     G
Way beyond empty inside
 D          A       G
Awaiting my end to arrive
