[Verse 1]
A                 Dmaj9/B
When I was just a boy
Dmaj9
We'll call it fifteen or so
A              Dmaj9/B
I found myself annoyed
Dmaj9
By a syndrome of sorts in my bones
A                       Dmaj9/B
That girl who's next to me ("Wait, next to- like, right next to-? Oh, God")
Dmaj9
She found herself bored to tears
A                          Dmaj9/B
She realized if she wanted conversation
Dmaj9*                             Dmaj9
She's out of luck for three more years
 
[Instrumental]
A Dmaj9/B Dmaj9 x2
Dmaj9
 
[Verse 2]
A                  Dmaj9/B
When I moved away from home
Dmaj9
One hundred miles or so
A                  Dmaj9/B
I knew a change had grown
Dmaj9
Inside my awkwardly long limbs and bones
A                    Dmaj9/B
That girl who's next to me
Dmaj9
She's friendly and thoughtful and quite awfully pretty
A                  Dmaj9/B
But all she has to say
Dmaj9*                               Dmaj9*
Is a meathead-themed monologue on why Brad ran away
 
[Chorus]
           A                          Dmaj9/B
She said, "All I can hope for is for me to get better
Dmaj9
'Cause all I can take is no more
A                         Dmaj9/B
I'll win him back again, we'll be lovers, best friends
Dmaj9
He won't need no other woman
                                          A Dmaj9/B Dmaj9
Like he did way back when he was with me
A                   Dmaj9/B
He needed more than me
Dmaj9
I'm friendly and thoughtful and quite awfully pretty
A*             Dmaj9/B*     Dmaj9*
But he needed more than me"
 
[Bridge]
        A*             Dmaj9/B*
When I felt that I should leave
Dmaj9*
We'll call it midnight or so
A*               Dmaj9/B*
I found myself annoyed
Dmaj9*
By a syndrome of sorts in her bones
A                       Dmaj9/B
That girl who's next to me
Dmaj9
She don't know her worth in this town
A                                         Dmaj9/B
'Cause her face starts to shine when that meathead behind me
Dmaj9
Is grinning as he's checking her out ("Oh, come on!")
 
[Chorus]
         A                                  Dmaj9/B
I said, "All I can hope for is for you to get better
Dmaj9
'Cause all I can take is no more
        A
So I'll hide where I can
            Dmaj9/B
Away from you and your friends
Dmaj9
Leaking tears over beers once again"
        A         Dmaj9/B           Dmaj9
Leaking tears over beers once again
               A*           Dmaj9/B*         Dmaj9*
You're leaking tears over beers once again
