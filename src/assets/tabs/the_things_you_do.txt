D        A        G         G
The Rolling Stones once sang a tune
D        A        G         Em
Singing words of sympathy yet none were sung for you
D        A        G         G
If the lord of darkness seen you comin' his way
D        A        G         Em
He'd get on his knees and look to Jesus 
Em7      Em7
and start to pray
