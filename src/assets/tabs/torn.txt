[Verse 1]
C                                        Em
   I thought I saw a girl brought to life
                                            F
She was warm, she came around like she was dignified
                                   C
She showed me what it was to cry
                                           Em
Well, you couldn't be that girl I adored
                                                   F
Don't seem to know, don't seem to care what your heart is for
 
But I don't know her anymore
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am                                    G
There's nothing where she used to lie
                            Em
My conversation has run dry
                        G
That's what's going on
                           C
Nothing's right, I'm torn
 
 
[Chorus]
                     G
I'm all out of faith
                   Am
This is how I feel
                         F
I'm cold and I am shamed
                          C
Lying naked on the floor
                         G
Illusion never changed
                     Am
Into something real
                    F
I'm wide awake and I can see
                        C
The perfect sky is torn
                    G                 Am  F
You're a little late, I'm already torn
 
 
[Verse 2]
C                                         Em
    So I guess the fortune teller's right
 
I should have seen just what was there
             F
And not some holy light
 
But you crawled beneath my veins and now
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am                           G
I don't care, I had no luck
                            Em
I don't miss it all that much
                            G
There's just so many things
                           C
That I can touch, I'm torn
 
 
[Chorus]
                     G
I'm all out of faith
                  Am
This is how I feel
                        F
I'm cold and I am shamed
                         C
Lying naked on the floor
                      G
Illusion never changed
                    Am
Into something real
                           F
I'm wide awake and I can see
                      C
The perfect sky is torn
                    G                 Am F
You're a little late, I'm already torn
 
Torn
 
 
[Bridge]
 Am                                   G
There's nothing where she used to lie
                           Em
My inspiration has run dry
                        G
That's what's going on
                          C
Nothing's right, I'm torn
 
 
[Chorus]
                      G
I'm all out of faith
                  Am
This is how I feel
                       F
I'm cold and I am shamed
                        C
Lying naked on the floor
                      G
Illusion never changed
                    Am
Into something real
                           F
I'm wide awake and I can see
                       C
The perfect sky is torn
                    G
I'm all out of faith
                  Am
This is how I feel
                        F
I'm cold and I'm ashamed
                             C
Bound and broken on the floor
                    G                 Am F
You're a little late, I'm already torn
